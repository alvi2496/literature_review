\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:conclusions}
Merging pull request is a very challenging task for the managing and integrating contributors \cite{Gousios2015}. It becomes more difficult when you do not have the required expertise on a topic and nobody seems not to care or view the topic. An automatic labeling system can help the developer to notice the pull requests related to their expertise however, this labeling system can be taken a step further to implement an automatic tagging system that can tag or invite the developers who have the expertise on a specific topic. There can also be some flaws to the reviews that the contributors make simply because of forgetting or not keeping up with the latest trends and inconsistencies due to something so simple as personal preference. This identification work can be extended to build a recommender system that could detect the flaws in the code review and suggest come correction or make the corrections all by itself.
